# Fall 2024 CS 4460 Final Project 
For the 6th lab/final project, we used a subset of the ```colleges.csv``` dataset to analyze fiscal data of students of city colleges and their families before and after graduation.


## To deploy visualization

Open terminal (or powershell if u rock with it), and start a local Python server on your machine in the folder containing the project (you should have python 3 installed) . 

  If we had to guess, we would assume it's at in your downloads somewhere after extracting the zip folder, but what do we know? You're the TA (or professor. hi professor). 
  
  For your convenience, once you've navigated to the folder in terminal (or powershell), run this line:
  
  ```powershell
  python -m http.server 8080 
  ```
(or any other combination of four numbers beginning with 8 if that doesn't work)

## Visualization Exploration

Feel free to navigate around the visualization in its default state or use the sorting or brushing features to look more closely at the data. 

The sortable properties are visible on the right side of the first chart, and the brush is set up for the scatter plot.

Refresh the page to clear brush selections.
